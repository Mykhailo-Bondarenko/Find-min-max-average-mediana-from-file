# We have a file with a large set of integer numbers (the file can be downloaded by reference):
## https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LxSB6UEAVK0NLgU0ah5y0CBbD0gL_oO9/ 
- Find the maximum number in the file;
- Find the minimum number in the file;
- Find median;
- Find average;
- * Find the largest sequence of numbers (which go one after another) that increases;
- * Find the largest sequence of numbers (which go one after the other), which is reduced;
## **The proposed solution method should find all four/six values from the file in no more than 90 seconds.**
